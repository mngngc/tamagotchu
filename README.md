# tamagotchu
A wellness game app created on Mendix to promote healthy routine for people with mental illnesses. The name and aesthetics of the app comes from 90s/00s kids' childhood toy called "Tamagotchi". The idea is instead of taking care of a digital pet, you are taking care of your avatar. By completing everyday's tasks and challenges, you will gain rewards or special customizations. 


The prototype are created on Figma and backend code uses Python programming lanaguage.
